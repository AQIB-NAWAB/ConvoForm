## What's new

In this release We majourly worked on improvement of form submission API response time, for this purpose we moved our conversation API route to [Vercel's Edge runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/edge-runtime). 
We also improved our UX by adding some transition animations and UI changes.

We added an Template chooser to help you generate form using AI.
